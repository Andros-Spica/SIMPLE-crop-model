# SIMPLE-crop-model
[NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) implementation by Andreas Angourakis (a.k.a. Andros-Spica) of the SIMPLE crop model by Zhao et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2019.01.009)

The current preliminary version has **S_CO2** crop parameter fixed at 0.001 (see [lines 475-478](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/SIMPLE-crop-model/blob/7d9f30d27d5bcde172911e8870e5c9301e40f480/SIMPLE-crop-model.nlogo#L475)) in order to have S_CO2 at the scale of 1, producing biomass and harvests at a "realistic" scale. (pending solving issue related to f(CO2), see flow diagram above)

Also pending implementation is the submodel calculating **ARID** using the equation given in the publication (see issue with f(Water) and soil parameters in the flow diagram above). In this preliminary version, the ARID value for each patch is generated by random number generator and fixed during the entire year, not expressing expected seasonality like the other input variables (see [line 318](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/SIMPLE-crop-model/blob/7d9f30d27d5bcde172911e8870e5c9301e40f480/SIMPLE-crop-model.nlogo#L318)). The obstacle for a complete implementation is that the detailed specification of how ARID is calculated is referred to [Woli et al. 2012](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/abstracts/104/2/287), which is not freely accessible from my institution.
